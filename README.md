LSR3 documents for TAAR1 agonists in psychosis

- Raw data is found in the /data folder
- /wrangling contains files required for data wrangling (data_wrangle_script.R which calls functions in wrangling_functions.R)
- Assuming the raw data and files requred for wrangling are downloaded with the markdown document, wrangling and meta-analysis can be performed entirely within the R markdown document
