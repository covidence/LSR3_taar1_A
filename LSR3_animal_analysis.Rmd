# 2. Description of experiment types 

Within the literature we identified 3 distinct categories of experimental interventions: 

1.  **"Simple interventions"**. These were experiments investigating the effect of administering a TAAR1 agonist alone. 

2.  **"Head to head"**. These were experiments investigating the effect of administering a TAAR1 agonist alongside a currently licensed anti-psychotic. 

3.  **"TAAR1 antagonist experiments**. These were experiments investigating the effect of administering a TAAR1 agonist alongside TAAR1 antagonism. In this iteration of the review, all experiments within this category administered to TAAR1 knock-out animals (i.e. used genetic TAAR1 antagonism).
    
Each experiment type will be analysed separately. This is because each experiment type uses different control conditions.

## 2.1 Simple interventions

In "simple intervention" studies the;

-   **Control group** is a group of animals that is (1) subjected to a psychosis model induction paradigm and (2) administered a control treatment (vehicle) or no treatment

-   **Intervention group** is a group of animals that is (1) subjected to a psychosis model induction paradigm and (2) administered a TAAR1 agonist treatment

-   **Sham group** is a group of animals that is (1) not subjected to a psychosis model induction paradigm and (2) administered a control treatment (vehicle) or no treatment

```{r # Split df by experiment and outcome type into dataframes to simply inline code below - simple interventions, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
df_S <- filter(df, ExperimentType == "Simple intervention")
df_S_LMA <- filter_experiment_outcome_type(df, "Simple intervention", "Locomotor activity")
df_S_PPI <- filter_experiment_outcome_type(df, "Simple intervention", "Prepulse inhibition")
df_S_cog <- filter_experiment_outcome_type(df, "Simple intervention", "Cognition")
df_S_social <- filter_experiment_outcome_type(df, "Simple intervention", "Social interaction")
df_S_stereo <- filter_experiment_outcome_type(df, "Simple intervention", "Stereotypy")
```

`r length(table(df_S$StudyId))` studies (`r nrow(df%>%filter(CohortType == "Simple intervention"))` comparisons) investigated the effects of simple interventions. The number of studies and individual effect sizes for each outcome were:

-   Locomotor activity*: `r length(table(df_S_LMA$StudyId))` studies and `r nrow(df_S_LMA)` comparisons in `r {strains <- unique(df_S_LMA$Strain); if (length(strains) > 1) paste(length(strains), "strains") else paste(length(strains), "strain")}`

-   Prepulse inhibition*: `r length(table(df_S_PPI$StudyId))` studies and `r nrow(df_S_PPI)` comparisons in `r {strains <- unique(df_S_PPI$Strain); if (length(strains) > 1) paste(length(strains), "strains") else paste(length(strains), "strain")}`

-   Cognitive function: `r length(table(df_S_cog$StudyId))` studies and `r nrow(df_S_cog)` comparisons in `r {strains <- unique(df_S_cog$Strain); if (length(strains) > 1) paste(length(strains), "strains") else paste(length(strains), "strain")}`

-   Social interaction: `r length(table(df_S_social$StudyId))` studies and `r nrow(df_S_social)` comparisons in `r {strains <- unique(df_S_social$Strain); if (length(strains) > 1) paste(length(strains), "strains") else paste(length(strains), "strain")}` 

-   Stereotypy: `r length(table(df_S_stereo$StudyId))` studies and `r nrow(df_S_stereo)` comparisons in `r {strains <- unique(df_S_stereo$Strain); if (length(strains) > 1) paste(length(strains), "strains") else paste(length(strains), "strain")}`

# 4. Meta-analyses by experiment type and outcome

Outcomes with â‰¥2 independent effect sizes were proceeded to meta-analysis. In this iteration of the review, this includes `r df %>% group_by(outcome_type) %>% filter(n_distinct(StudyId) > 1) %>% summarise(n = n_distinct(StudyId)) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% pull(outcome_type) %>% unique() %>% tolower() %>% { if (length(.) > 1) paste(paste(head(., -1), collapse = ", "), "and", tail(., 1)) else .}`. 

All analyses were accounting for the following hierarchical levels (random effects):

-   **Level 1: Rodent strain** - effect sizes measured within the same rodent strain

-   **Level 2: Study** - effect sizes measured within the same study

-   **Level 3: Experiment** - effect sizes measured in the same experiment within a study, where often a control group contributes to several effect sizes

*NB: We constructed multilevel models without Knapp-Hartung adjustments as these are not available for rma.mv class objects in the metafor package* ([metafor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/metafor.pdf)). *Instead, the model is set to `test = "t"` to use t- and F-distributions for making inferences, and `dfs="contain"` to improve the method of approximating degrees of freedom of these distributions.*

The scales/units used to measure outcomes in preclinical studies often differ between studies. The primary effect size used for meta-analysis of preclinical studies is therefore the standardised mean difference (SMD, Hedgeâ€™s g). We will perform a sensitivity analysis using normalised mean difference (NMD) where there is sufficient data. 

## 4.1 Simple interventions

### 4.1.1 Outcome 1: Locomotor activity (a primary outcome)

The effect of administering a TAAR1 agonist on locomotor activity in animals using SMD as the effect size is shown in Figure 2. The pooled estimate for SMD across all individual comparisons is displayed as a diamond shape at the bottom of the plot. Dotted lines indicate the prediction interval of the pooled estimate.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
SMD_S_LMA <- run_ML_SMD(df, "Simple intervention", "Locomotor activity", 0.5)
```

**Figure 2**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.height=10}
forest_metafor(SMD_S_LMA, "locomotor activity")
```

For simple interventions, TAAR1 interventions had a pooled effect on locomotor activity of SMD = `r SMD_S_LMA[["beta"]]` (95% CI: `r SMD_S_LMA[["ci.lb"]]` to `r SMD_S_LMA[["ci.ub"]]` with a prediction interval of `r predict(SMD_S_LMA)$pi.lb` to `r predict(SMD_S_LMA)$pi.ub`.

Between-strain variance was `r SMD_S_LMA$sigma2[1]`, between-study variance was `r SMD_S_LMA$sigma2[2]`, and within-study variance (between experiments) was `r SMD_S_LMA$sigma2[3]`

### 4.1.2 Outcome 2: Cognition (a secondary outcome)

The effect of administering a TAAR1 agonist on cognitive outcomes in animals using SMD as the effect size is shown in Figure 3. The pooled estimate for SMD across all individual comparisons is displayed as a diamond shape at the bottom of the plot. Dotted lines indicate the prediction interval of the pooled estimate.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
SMD_S_cog <- run_ML_SMD(df, "Simple intervention", "Cognition", 0.5)
```

**Figure 3**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.height=7}
forest_metafor(SMD_S_cog, "cognition")
```

For simple interventions, TAAR1 interventions had a pooled effect on cognitive outcomes of SMD = `r SMD_S_cog[["beta"]]` (95% CI: `r SMD_S_cog[["ci.lb"]]` to `r SMD_S_cog[["ci.ub"]]` with a prediction interval of `r predict(SMD_S_cog)$pi.lb` to `r predict(SMD_S_cog)$pi.ub`.

Between-strain variance was `r SMD_S_cog$sigma2[1]`, between-study variance was `r SMD_S_cog$sigma2[2]`, and within-study variance (between experiments) was `r SMD_S_cog$sigma2[3]`

## 4.2 "Head to head" interventions

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
SMD_S_LMA_H2H <- run_ML_SMD(df, "Head to head", "Locomotor activity", 0.5)
```

**Figure n**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.height=10}
forest_metafor(SMD_S_LMA_H2H, "Locomotor activity")
```


# 5. Subgroup analyses

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
options(scipen=100, digits=3)
```

For each outcome, the covariates of interest for subgroup analyses were; 

- **Sex**

- **Category of disease induction** 

- **Route of intervention administration**

- **Whether the intervention was prophylactic or therapeutic (i.e. administered before or after disease model induction)**

- **Duration of treatment period**

- **The intervention administered**

- **The efficacy of the drug (i.e. whether the drug is a partial or full agonist)**

- **The selectivity of the drug**

We also conducted subgroup analyses using **(1) SYRCLE Risk of Bias** and **(2) ARRIVE reporting quality** assessment scores as covariates to evaluate their influence on effect size estimates.

## 5.1 Simple interventions

### 5.1.1 Outcome 1: Locomotor activity

##### 5.1.1.1 Sex

Figure 4 displays the estimates for the pooled SMD's when comparisons are stratified by sex of the animal. Whiskers indicate the 95% confidence interval of each estimate. The overall pooled SMD, not stratified by sex, is displayed as a diamond shape at the bottom of the plot. 

**Figure 4**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide', fig.width=8.5, fig.height=3} 
SMD_S_LMA_sex <- plot_subgroup_analysis(df, "Simple intervention", "Locomotor activity", "Sex", 0.5)
```

`r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Not reported", "k"]` comparisons did not report the sex of the animals used within the experimental cohort. `r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Male", "k"]` comparisons used cohorts of only male animals and `r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Female", "k"]` comparisons used cohorts of only female animals. There were `r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Mixed male and female", "k"]` comparisons using cohorts of both male and female animals. 

The pooled SMD estimate for male animals was `r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Male", "SMD"]`, for females `r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Female", "SMD"]`, and for mixed cohorts `r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Mixed male and female", "SMD"]`. The pooled SMD estimate for comparisons not reporting the sex of the animals within the experimental cohort was `r SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_sex$subgroup_rma_summary$Sex == "Not reported", "SMD"]`. 

##### 5.1.1.2 Category of disease induction

Figure 5 displays the estimates for the pooled SMD's when comparisons are stratified by the category of disease induction. Whiskers indicate the 95% confidence interval of each estimate. The overall pooled SMD, not stratified by category of disease induction, is displayed as a diamond shape at the bottom of the plot. 

**Figure 5**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide', fig.width=11, fig.height=2.5} 
SMD_S_LMA_CatDisInd <- plot_subgroup_analysis(df, "Simple intervention", "Locomotor activity", "CategoryDiseaseInduction", 0.5)

##### 5.1.1.10 ARRIVE reporting quality guidelines

Experiments were categorised based on the number of ARRIVE guidelines (of which there are 23) met. The categorisation was as follows: Experiments meeting 3 or fewer criteria were labeled as "A: < 3 criteria met"; those meeting 4 to 7 criteria were labeled "B: 4-7 criteria met"; for 8 to 11 criteria, "C: 8-11 criteria met"; for 12 to 15 criteria, "D: 12-15 criteria met"; for 16 to 19 criteria, "E: 16-19 criteria met"; and experiments meeting more than 19 criteria were labeled as "F: > 20 criteria met". 

Figure x displays the estimates for the pooled SMD's when comparisons are stratified by this categorisation that the experiment met. Whiskers indicate the 95% confidence interval of each estimate. The overall pooled SMD, not stratified by ARRIVE reporting quality guidelines, is displayed as a diamond shape at the bottom of the plot.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide', fig.width=9, fig.height=5} 
SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE <- plot_subgroup_analysis(df, "Simple intervention", "Locomotor activity", "ARRIVEScoreCat", 0.5)
```

`r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "B: 4-7 criteria met", "k"]` experiments met between 4-7 of the ARRIVE reporting quality criteria. `r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "C: 8-11 criteria met", "k"]` experiments met between 8-11, `r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "D: 12-15 criteria met", "k"]` experiments met between 12-15, `r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "E: 16-19 criteria met", "k"]` experiments met between 16-19. No experiment met below 4 or above 19 of the ARRIVE reporting quality criteria.

The pooled SMD estimate for the effect of TAAR1 agonists on locomotor activity in experiments that met between 4-7 of the ARRIVE reporting quality criteria was `r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "4-7 criteria met", "SMD"]`. The estimate for experiments that met between 8-11 of the ARRIVE reporting quality criteria was `r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "8-11 criteria met", "SMD"]`, for those experiments that met between 12-15 of the ARRIVE reporting quality criteria `r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "12-15 criteria met", "SMD"]`, and for those experiments that met between 16-19 of the ARRIVE reporting quality criteria `r SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary[SMD_S_LMA_ARRIVE$subgroup_rma_summary$ARRIVEScoreCat == "16-19 criteria met", "SMD"]`.

# 6. Meta-regression analyses

For each outcome, the variables of interest for meta-regression analyses are; 

- **The potency of the intervention** 

- **The dose of the intervention administered** 

## 6.1 Meta-regression analyses for simple interventions

### 6.1.1 Locomotor activity

#### 6.1.1.1 Potency of intervention

The pEC50 value of each drug was used to measure potency. The pEC50 value is the negative logarithm (to base 10) of the EC50 value. Higher pEC50 values indicate higher potency (as they indicate a lower EC50). Figure x displays a visualisation of the meta-regression using the pEC50 value as an explanatory variable. Dashed lines represent the 95% confidence interval of the regression line. The dotted lines represent the 95% prediction interval. Raw data is plotted with 'bubble' size adjusted according to effect size precision. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
SMD_S_LMA_potency <- metaregression_analysis(df, "Simple intervention", "Locomotor activity", "pE50", 0.5)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE,}
SMD_S_LMA_potency$regression_plot
```

The estimate for \( \theta \) was `r SMD_S_LMA_potency$metaregression_summary$beta[1] `. This gives the predicted SMD when the pEC50 of the intervention is 0. Note that this should be interpreted with caution; since the logarithm of zero is undefined (it tends towards negative infinity), a pEC50 value cannot be 0 unless the EC50 is 1 mol/L. The estimate for \( \theta \) can be interpreted as the estimated SMD when the EC50 is 1 mol/L (1000mM), which signifies extremely low potency. 

The estimate for \( \beta \) was `r SMD_S_LMA_potency$metaregression_summary$beta[2]`. This represents the predicted regression weight for the pEC50 of the intervention. 

#### 6.1.1.2 Dose of intervention

In this iteration of the review, the TAAR1 agonists administered in 'simple intervention' experiments (ordered by number of experiments) were; **`r drugs <- df %>% filter(ExperimentType == "Simple intervention") %>% filter(outcome_type == "Locomotor activity") %>% group_by(DrugName) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% pull(DrugName); if (length(drugs) > 1) {paste(paste(head(drugs, -1), collapse = ", "), "and", tail(drugs, 1))} else {drugs}`**. Meta-regression using the administered dose as an explanatory variable was first conducted individually for each drug/intervention. This approach accounts for varying mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of each drug, ensuring that the dose effect of one intervention is not masked by aggregate data. 

In the following plots, dashed lines represent the 95% confidence interval of the regression line and dotted lines represent the 95% prediction interval. Raw data is plotted with point size adjusted according to effect size precision.

##### 6.1.1.2.11 Standardised dose

We then sought evidence of a dose response relationship across all drugs. To do this, we conducted meta-regression using a standardised dose variable. This variable quantifies the administered dose as a multiple of the drug's EC50, indicating how many times the dose administered was greater (or lesser) than the concentration needed to achieve half-maximal effect. For example, if a drug's dose is twice its EC50, the standardized dose would be 2, indicating that the dose is twice the concentration needed to achieve half-maximal effect. 

The standardised dose was calculated by dividing the log-transformed dose of the intervention (in mg/kg) by the product of the intervention's EC50 (in moles) and the Molar mass of the drug (in mg/mol):

$$
\frac{\log(\text{Dose of Intervention (mg/kg)})}{(\text{Molar Mass (g/mol)} \times 1000) \times (\frac{\text{EC50 (micromoles)}}{1000000})}
$$

**This is a simplified approximation based on the reasoning that if drug actions are mediated through the TAAR1 receptor, and drug efficacy is reflected in the respective EC50 values, then theoretically drugs should exhibit similar effects when acting at their respective EC50.** 

The actual concentration of a drug at the receptor site is influenced by several variables, including dosage, administration route, elimination half-life, and first-pass metabolism (in case of oral administration). Incorporating all these factors accurately would necessitate a detailed pharmacokinetic model, which falls outside the scope of this review. Consequently, we assume uniformity across experiments in terms of (i) volume of distribution, (ii) first-pass metabolism, (iii) blood-brain barrier permeability, and (iv) experimental design, especially regarding the timing of peak drug concentration (where we assume that experiments were designed to be done at a time when the drug was near peak concentration). 

Figure x provides a visualisation of the meta-regression analysis predicting the response, measured as the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD), in locomotor activity to varying standardised doses of TAAR1 agonists. As before, dashed lines represent the 95% confidence interval of the regression line and dotted lines represent the 95% prediction interval. Raw data is plotted with point size adjusted according to effect size precision.

The estimate for \( \theta \) was `r SMD_S_LMA_StandardDose$metaregression_summary$beta[1] `. The estimate for \( \beta \) was `r SMD_S_LMA_StandardDose$metaregression_summary$beta[2]`.

### 6.1.2 Cognition

#### 6.1.2.1 Potency of intervention

The pEC50 value of each drug was again used to measure potency. Higher pEC50 values indicate higher potency (as they indicate a lower EC50). Figure x displays a visualisation of the meta-regression using the pEC50 value as an explanatory variable. Dashed lines represent the 95% confidence interval of the regression line. The dotted lines represent the 95% prediction interval. Raw data is plotted with 'bubble' size adjusted according to effect size precision. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
SMD_S_cog_potency <- metaregression_analysis(df, "Simple intervention", "Cognition", "pE50", 0.5)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE,}
SMD_S_cog_potency$regression_plot
```

The estimate for \( \theta \) was `r SMD_S_cog_potency$metaregression_summary$beta[1] `. This gives the predicted SMD when the pEC50 of the intervention is 0. Note that this should be interpreted with caution; since the logarithm of zero is undefined (it tends towards negative infinity), a pEC50 value cannot be 0 unless the EC50 is 1 mol/L. The estimate for \( \theta \) can be interpreted as the estimated SMD when the EC50 is 1 mol/L (1000mM), which signifies extremely low potency. 

The estimate for \( \beta \) was `r SMD_S_cog_potency$metaregression_summary$beta[2]`. This represents the predicted regression weight for the pEC50 of the intervention. 

#### 6.1.2.2 Dose of intervention

In this iteration of the review, the TAAR1 agonists administered in 'simple intervention' experiments (ordered by number of experiments) were; **`r drugs <- df %>% filter(ExperimentType == "Simple intervention") %>% filter(outcome_type == "Cognition") %>% group_by(DrugName) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% pull(DrugName); if (length(drugs) > 1) {paste(paste(head(drugs, -1), collapse = ", "), "and", tail(drugs, 1))} else {drugs}`**. Meta-regression using the administered dose as an explanatory variable was first conducted individually for each drug/intervention. This approach accounts for varying mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of each drug, ensuring that the dose effect of one intervention is not masked by aggregate data.

##### 6.1.2.2.2 RO5203648

In this iteration of the review, all relevant comparisons used the same dose of RO5203648 (1 mg/kg). Therefore, meta-regression on the dose on intervention was not conducted for this drug.

##### 6.1.2.2.3 RO5256390

In this iteration of the review, there was insufficient data to perform meta-regression on the dose on intervention for RO5256390 (only a single data point for each dose of RO5256390 administered)

##### 6.1.2.2.4 Standardised dose

As for locomotor activity, we then sought evidence of a dose response relationship across all drugs using the standardised dose variable. 

Figure x provides a visualisation of the meta-regression analysis predicting the response, measured as the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD), in cognition to varying standardised doses of TAAR1 agonists.

**2.  Imputed rho values of 0.2 and 0.8**

**3.  NMD analysis**

#### 7.1.1.2 Imputed rho values of 0.2 and 0.8

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
SMD_S_LMA_rho0.2 <- run_ML_SMD(df, "Simple intervention", "Locomotor activity", 0.2)
```

**When the $\rho$ value is assumed to be 0.2**, the TAAR1 interventions had a pooled effect on locomotor activity of **SMD = `r SMD_S_LMA_rho0.2[["beta"]]`** (95% CI: `r SMD_S_LMA_rho0.2[["ci.lb"]]` to `r SMD_S_LMA_rho0.2[["ci.ub"]]` with a prediction interval of `r predict(SMD_S_LMA_rho0.2)$pi.lb` to `r predict(SMD_S_LMA_rho0.2)$pi.ub`.

For reference the pooled effect size when rho is assumed to be 0.5 is `r SMD_S_LMA[["beta"]]` (95% CI: `r SMD_S_LMA[["ci.lb"]]` to `r SMD_S_LMA[["ci.ub"]]`).

#### 7.1.1.3 NMD 
For locomotor activity, an NMD was calculable for `r df_S_LMA %>% filter(NMD_possible == "TRUE") %>% nrow()` out of `r nrow(df_S_LMA)` comparisons, i.e. `r ((df_S_LMA %>% filter(NMD_possible == "TRUE") %>% nrow())/(nrow(df_S_LMA)))*100` % of comparisons.

The effect of administering a TAAR1 agonist on locomotor activity in animals using NMD as the effect size is shown in Figure x. The pooled estimate for NMD across all individual comparisons is displayed as a diamond shape at the bottom of the plot. Dotted lines indicate the prediction interval of the pooled estimate.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}

For reference the pooled effect size when rho is assumed to be 0.5 is `r SMD_S_cog[["beta"]]` (95% CI: `r SMD_S_cog[["ci.lb"]]` to `r SMD_S_cog[["ci.ub"]]`). 

#### 7.1.2.3 NMD

For cognition, an NMD was calculable for `r df_S_cog %>% filter(NMD_possible == "TRUE") %>% nrow()` out of `r nrow(df_S_cog)` comparisons, i.e. `r ((df_S_cog %>% filter(NMD_possible == "TRUE") %>% nrow())/(nrow(df_S_cog)))*100` % of comparisons.
