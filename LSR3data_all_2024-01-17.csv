BECAUSE TRACE AMINES ALSO INFLUENCE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER TARGETS, SELECTIVE LIGANDS ARE NEEDED FOR THE ELUCIDATION OF TAAR1 FUNCTION. HERE WE REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FIRST SELECTIVE AND POTENT TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST. METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY. IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. FURTHERMORE, IT ATTENUATED DRUG-TAKING BEHAVIOR AND WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING ATTENTION, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND WAKEFULNESS. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE FIRST POTENT AND SELECTIVE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST, RO5203648, WE SHOW THAT TAAR1 IS IMPLICATED IN A BROAD RANGE OF RELEVANT PHYSIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DIMENSIONS.

DRUG DEVELOPMENT OF NON-D2 COMPOUNDS, SEEKING TO AVOID THE LIMITING SIDE EFFECTS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTOR BLOCKADE, HAS FAILED TO DATE TO YIELD NEW MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS. IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS.

TAS ARE LIGANDS FOR THE RECENTLY IDENTIFIED TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), AN IMPORTANT MODULATOR OF MONOAMINE NEUROTRANSMISSION. HERE, WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF TAAR1 HYPERSIGNALING BY GENERATING A TRANSGENIC MOUSE LINE OVEREXPRESSING TAAR1 SPECIFICALLY IN NEURONS. TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE DID NOT SHOW OVERT BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES UNDER BASELINE CONDITIONS, DESPITE AUGMENTED EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND NORADRENALINE IN THE ACCUMBENS NUCLEUS (ACB) AND OF SEROTONIN IN THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX. IN VITRO, THIS WAS CORRELATED WITH AN ELEVATED SPONTANEOUS FIRING RATE OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA, DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, AND LOCUS COERULEUS AS THE RESULT OF ECTOPIC TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE WERE HYPOSENSITIVE TO THE PSYCHOSTIMULANT EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE, AS IT PRODUCED ONLY A WEAK LOCOMOTOR ACTIVATION AND FAILED TO ALTER CATECHOLAMINE RELEASE IN THE ACB.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE.

THE MECHANISM UNDERLYING THIS IS UNCLEAR BUT MAY BE DUE TO N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR (NMDAR) HYPOFUNCTION AND PARVALBUMIN (PV) NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION LEADING TO DISINHIBITION OF MESOSTRIATAL DOPAMINE NEURONS. HERE, WE DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODEL OF THE DOPAMINE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SEEN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TEST APPROACHES TO REVERSE THE DOPAMINE CHANGES. MICE WERE TREATED WITH SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE (30 MG/KG) OR SALINE AND THEN RECEIVED IN VIVO POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OF STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY, ANALOGOUS TO MEASURES USED IN PATIENTS. LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING THE OPEN-FIELD TEST. IN VIVO CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE USED TO MANIPULATE NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND RNA SEQUENCING WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE INCREASED STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY (COHEN’S D = 2.5) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THESE EFFECTS WERE COUNTERED BY INHIBITION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND BY ACTIVATION OF PV INTERNEURONS IN PRE-LIMBIC CORTEX AND VENTRAL SUBICULUM OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE REDUCED PV EXPRESSION IN THESE CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION WITH SEP-363856, A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH AGONISM AT TRACE AMINE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS BUT NO APPRECIABLE ACTION AT DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE KETAMINE-INDUCED INCREASE IN DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE TREATMENT IN MICE MIMICS THE DOPAMINERGIC ALTERATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS, THAT THIS REQUIRES ACTIVATION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND CAN BE AMELIORATED BY ACTIVATING PV INTERNEURONS AND BY A TAAR1/5-HT1A AGONIST.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

IN ADDITION, ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS TRIGGER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS THAT PRECIPITATE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION. HERE, WE SHOW THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), A MODULATOR OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION, REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTION. IN RODENTS, ACTIVATION OF TAAR1 BY TWO NOVEL AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY DISTINCT COMPOUNDS, THE FULL AGONIST RO5256390 AND THE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397, BLOCKS PSYCHOSTIMULANT-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY AND PRODUCES A BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG OLANZAPINE, SUGGESTING ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. TAAR1 AGONISTS DO NOT INDUCE CATALEPSY OR WEIGHT GAIN: RO5263397 EVEN REDUCED HALOPERIDOL-INDUCED CATALEPSY AND PREVENTED OLANZAPINE FROM INCREASING BODY WEIGHT AND FAT ACCUMULATION.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE.

IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.
